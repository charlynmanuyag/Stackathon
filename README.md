### Welcome to Crawl!

Have you ever tried to plan a bar crawl with your friends and forgot what bars you will be hitting? Crawl is a phone app built using 
React Native to plan out your night!

#### Geolocation
The app uses the user's current location to pull out bars from the Yelp's API

#### Yelp's API
Yelp's API provides us with information such as images, names of the bar, address, phone number, ratings, price marks and so forth.

#### Functionality
This app will give the user a board profile where the user can pin all the bars they are planning to hit! 
If the user ever changed their mind or have finished visiting the bar, they can unpin from the board as well

#### Local storage
This app uses AsyncStorage to persist the data on a user's device, therefore this will only work if a user is using only one device
